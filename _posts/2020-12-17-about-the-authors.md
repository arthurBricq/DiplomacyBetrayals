# Arthur 

My name is Arthur Bricq, I like outdoor sports more than programming (*but I do a lot more of programming than outdoor sports*). I have a bachelor in mechanical engineering and I now study robotics, however I always was passionated by computer science and by all sort of programmings. I am open-source enthusiast. I have worked in many different languages, the ones I know the more are Python, Swift, Java, C++ and Matlab.
