We are 3 students from EPFL in robotic master. Here is a quick description of our skills.

# Arthur 

My name is Arthur Bricq, I like outdoor sports more than programming (*but I do a lot more of programming than outdoor sports*). I have a bachelor in mechanical engineering and I now study robotics, however I always was passionated by computer science and by all sort of programmings. I am open-source enthusiast. I have worked in many different languages, the ones I know the more are Python, Swift, Java, Javascript, C++ and Matlab. I'm curious about Bash and about Lisp, that I would like to learn when I find time. 

# Taavet

My name is Taavet Kangur. I've always loved building things with my hands and using programming to make robots as I want. They got smaller as I studied Microtechnics as a bachelor and now are bigger as I'm finishing my master in Robotics at EPFL. C++ and Python are my main languages for progamming. Otherwise swimming and climing are my main favorite pasttimes when not working on projects.
